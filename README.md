Snippet Saver stores your code snippets so you can easily refer to them later. It also houses a library of other users' shared snippets that you might find useful for your own projects.

Check out my blog post about how I [used nested layouts with Sinatra & ERB](https://allysonw.github.io/nested_layouts_in_sinatra_with_erb) in this project.

## Installation
Clone this repository and run `bundle install` to install the needed gems. Migrate the database with `rake db:migrate`. From the main directory, run `shotgun` and navigate to http://localhost:9393/ to launch the site.

## Usage
At the home page, create an account to sign in. You can create, view, edit, and delete your own snippets from the My Snippets tab. You can view other users' snippets from the Snippet Library tab.
